[Mocking API responses](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/mock-api-responses) is a great way to empower developers code against an agreed upon constract without putting strain on your services. Futhermore, this allows for both APIs and consuming code to be implemented at the same time by multiple teams. 

API mocks give us the ability to collaborate and iterate (design, test and document) API fa√ßades first and implement the backend services at later time.

The ability to mock up API responses makes it possible to implementation and test new Azure API Management instances even if the backend is not avialable.
