# Megaphone

## Why Megaphone?

This is a tool I use to help me keep track of all the updates and announcements.

Azure and the Dev world evolves at a terrying pace! Keeping up with it all takes time and generates unnunnecessary cognitive load... Megaphone is all about streamlining my workflow and drastically reducing the cognitive load required to stay current on this ever chaning world.
